General
=======
- Checks for the existence of external programs
- More logging (debug/info)
- Replace non-interactive puts()-calls with logging.info()-calls
- Write documentation

API
===
- Hooks for plugins in commands.postprocess and commands.wizard
- Better docstrings (at least for public interfaces)
- Refactor to abstract as much away from UI-specific code to prepare for an
  eventual (optional) PySide GUI.



Plugin ideas
============
- PDF (pdfbeads) and DJVU (djvubind) plugins for postprocess
- Metadata plugin for postprocess using OpenLibrary for ISBN-queries and
  DublinCore for serialization
- Archive.org upload plugin
