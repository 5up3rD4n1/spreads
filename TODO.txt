General
=======
- Enhance confit to allow the writing of configuration files to disk, this
  probably involves monkey-patching yaml.serializer.Serializer
- Add support for different scanning profiles that can be selected
  (e.g.: 'illustrations', 'text'), involves enhancing confit to load
  configuration from arbitrary files.
- More tests, espescially for included plugins
- Find a way to re-use CLI arguments in the wizard

API
===
- Hooks for plugins in commands.wizard
- Refactor to abstract as much away from UI-specific code to prepare for an
  eventual (optional) PySide GUI.

Plugin ideas
============
- OCR plugin leveraging ocropus or tesseract
- CBR (rar) plugin
- Metadata plugin using OpenLibrary for ISBN-queries and Dublin Core for
  serialization
- Archive.org upload plugin
