General
=======
- Make path argument subcommand-specific again (for plugins that create their
  own workflow objects)
- Use 'configure' command to select driver, plugins and write initial
  configuration
- Clean up GUI code, it's an unholy mess...
- Refactor tests, they need work on several levels:
    * more specific: what should a method *do*/*effects*
    * less mock objects
    * better coverage

Plugin ideas
============
- CBR (rar) plugin
- Metadata plugin using OpenLibrary for ISBN-queries and Dublin Core for
  serialization
- Archive.org upload plugin

Bugs
====
